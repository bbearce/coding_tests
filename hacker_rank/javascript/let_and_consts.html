// Objective

// In this challenge, we practice declaring variables using the let and const keywords. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

// Task

// Declare a constant variable, PI, and assign it the value Math.PI. You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named PI (uppercase).
// Read a number, r, denoting the radius of a circle from stdin.
// Use PI and r to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle having radius r.
// Print area as the first line of output and print perimeter as the second line of output.
// Input Format

// A single integer, r, denoting the radius of a circle.

// Constraints
// * 0 < r <= 100
// * r is a floating-point number scaled to at most 3 decimal places.
// Output Format

// Print the following two lines:

// On the first line, print the area of the circle having radius .
// On the second line, print the perimeter of the circle having radius r.


    // Write your code here. Read input using 'readLine()' and print output using 'console.log()'.
    const PI = Math.PI
    var r,area,perimeter;
    // r = readLine() I used this on hacker rank becauase they had a console through Node.js
    // r = 2.6 in the browser there isn't a proper console, so you need to enter in something manually
    area = PI*r**2
    perimeter = 2*PI*r

    // Print the area of the circle:
    console.log(area)
    // Print the perimeter of the circle:
    console.log(perimeter)
    
    try {    
        // Attempt to redefine the value of constant variable PI
        PI = 0;
        // Attempt to print the value of PI
        console.log(PI);
    } catch(error) {
        console.error("You correctly declared 'PI' as a constant.");
    }
}
