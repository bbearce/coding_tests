# In this challenge, you will be given  integers, n and m.
# There are m words, which might repeat, in word group A.
# There are m words belonging to word group B. 
# For each m words, check whether the word has appeared in group A or not.
# Print the indices of each occurrence of m in group A.
# If it does not appear, print -1.
